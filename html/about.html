			<div id="aboutText">
			<p>Born in Toledo, Ohio, Veronica Lin grew up with many passions. They were very diverse from sports such as basketball to music such as playing the violin. Her love for numbers and more analytical aspects came from her parents, who worked in the mathematics and accounting fields. Even though there is an above average age gap between Veronica and her older brother, they still remain close and very supportive of each other.</p>

			<p>One of the passions that she really fostered was her love of service. Even in elementary school Veronica had a big heart for helping others. She frequently aided a student with cerebral palsy and went on to become a peer leader to help classmates resolve difficult conflict. All throughout high school she was involved with an organization called Key Club. During her third year, she served as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 3 of Michigan.</p>

			<p>Another large part of Veronica&#39;s identity was formed during her years at a summer conference called Taiwanese American Foundation. There, Veronica learned more about her culture, connected with many individuals from all over the country, and continued to learn and grow as an individual. There were many seminars and discussions. Although the conference was short, many life long bonds were formed. It was always a week out of the 52 of the year that she really looked forward to.</p>

			<p>Currently Veronica is a student at Drexel University. She loves pugs and enjoys eating watermelon. In her spare time, she is slowly discovering more of the city of Philadelphia. Veronica enjoys reading and crushing her opponents in a game of Monopoly Deal. She enjoys learning about other individuals and discovering the many things that they have to offer.</p>
